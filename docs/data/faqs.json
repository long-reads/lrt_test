    "id": "FAQ5",
    "question": "Hey, that badge looks out of date?",
    "answer": "To help the website display properly we use local versions of software badges (or shields) that are downloaded when the site is built. This means that some badges may be slightly out of date, but it should only be a problem for tools that have been updated very recently (in the last week or so). To see the last time the site was built check the footer at the bottom of the page."
